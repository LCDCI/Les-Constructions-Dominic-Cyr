Fixed the delete issue so teammates can build and run the branch without failures. The problem was that the UUID constraint was too strict and migrations weren't running on existing databases. I relaxed the constraint to accept alphanumeric strings and added automatic migration execution in config.go that runs all SQL files at startup. Now teammates can just pull and rebuild - no manual database steps needed.
